                  <p class="intro">
                    I am Chandreyee Shome. I am a 1st year CSE undergrad at <a href = "https://snuniv.ac.in/"><em>Sister Nivedita University</em></a>, Newtown.

                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                      I enjoy making basic programmes a little more practical. It inspires me to think creatively and develop new coding abilities. I have a basic understanding of the Java and C programming languages. I'm on my way to learning more.

                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>i am just a beginner in this field, but i am quite enjoying it. in our day to lives we come across a number of websites and webpages, to be able to develop on my own is a lot of fun. also, this opens a window for my creative side.</p>

                    <h3>Dancing</h3>
                    <p>When I was younger, I had professional dancing lessons for a few years. As a hobby, I continue to practise dancing. I often perform at events and festivals. Dancing and web development have a lot in common: so many days of rehearsal for a few minutes of performance, just like, so much code and then so little changes on the internet. Dance allows me to meet new people and create new experiences.</p>

                    <h3>Movie And Character Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy watching movies, webseries, and short films. Not simply observe, but also analyse each and every detail. As I watch or read a tale, I analyse the characters' tones and emotions, as well as their backgrounds and motivations. Human psychology is highly intriguing, and the addition of creative literary writing makes it much more so.</p>
