## Overview

This repository contains the code for the second website I created while learning frontend development through a course on Udemy. The project focuses on implementing various HTML and CSS techniques to build a functional and aesthetically pleasing website.

### Key Objectives:
- Apply updated HTML and CSS to create a modern web page.
- Understand and use divs effectively for page layout.
- Master absolute and relative positioning of elements.
- Create a custom Favicon for the website.
- Design interactive buttons and add functional links.
