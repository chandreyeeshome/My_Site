## Overview

This repository contains the code for the second website I created while learning frontend development through a course on Udemy. The project focuses on implementing various HTML and CSS techniques to build a functional and aesthetically pleasing website.

### Key Objectives:
- Apply updated HTML and CSS to create a modern web page.
- Understand and use divs effectively for page layout.
- Master absolute and relative positioning of elements.
- Create a custom Favicon for the website.
- Design interactive buttons and add functional links.

## Features

- **Modern HTML and CSS**: Utilizes up-to-date HTML and CSS practices to build a responsive and accessible website.
- **Div-Based Layouts**: Efficient use of `<div>` elements to structure the web pages.
- **Positioning**: Uses absolute and relative positioning to place elements precisely on the page.
- **Custom Favicon**: A unique Favicon created and added to the website.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Custom-designed buttons that enhance user interaction.
- **Hyperlinks**: Functional links to navigate between pages and external resources.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language used to create the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: The stylesheet language used to style and layout the web pages.
- **Favicon**: Custom icon that represents the website in browser tabs.

## Learning Outcomes

While developing this project, I gained experience in:
- Structuring web pages using modern HTML5 elements.
- Styling and positioning elements using CSS3.
- Creating and implementing a custom Favicon.
- Designing and coding interactive elements like buttons.
- Adding and styling hyperlinks for navigation and external linking.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandreyeeshome/My_site.git
   cd My_site
   ```

2. **Open the HTML files in a web browser:**
   - You can open `index.html` directly in your browser to see the landing page.
   - Navigate to `about.html` and `contact.html` for additional pages.

Alternatively, you can deploy the website on a web server or a platform like GitHub Pages to view it online.
